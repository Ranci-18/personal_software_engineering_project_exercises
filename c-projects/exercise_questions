Here are a few exercises and projects you can try to practice your Python skills with lists and arrays:
    1. Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.
    2. Write a function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list with all the strings in uppercase.
    3. Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the median (middle value) of the list. If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle values.
    4. Write a program that reads a list of integers from a file and prints out the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
    5. Write a program that stores a list of your favorite movies and their release years. Then, use the list to print out all the movies released before a certain year (e.g. 2000).
    6. Write a program that generates a list of random integers and then sorts the list in ascending order.
    7. Write a program that takes in a list of names and creates a new list with the names reversed (e.g. ["Alice", "Bob"] becomes ["ecilA", "boB"]).
    8. Write a program that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers.
    9. Write a program that implements the selection sort algorithm to sort a list of integers.
    10. Write a program that reads a list of words from a file and prints out all the words that are palindromes (words that are the same backwards and forwards, like "racecar").
C-exercises
Write a program that asks the user to input their age, and then prints out how many days old they are.
    1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in degrees Celsius, and then converts and prints the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
       Prompt user to input temperature in Celcius
       store the value in a temperature variable
       convert/compute the temperature using an expression: (9/5) * (celcius + 32)
       print the value to the user
    2. Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program should ask the user to input the length and width of the rectangle, and then print the calculated area and perimeter.
       Declare the variables: length, width, area, perimeter
       prompt the user to input length and width and store the values
       compute 
       output the area and perimeter
       end program
    3. Write a program that reads in a list of integers and then prints out the smallest and largest values in the list.
    4. Write a program that simulates a simple calculator. The program should ask the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /), and then print out the result of the operation.
    5. Write a program that simulates a simple calculator. The program should ask the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /), and then print out the result of the operation.
